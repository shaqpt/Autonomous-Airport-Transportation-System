# Autonomous-Airport-Transportation-System
Source Code for a mimic Autonomous Airport Transportation System project given in an Embedded Systems Design Project course at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.


The files within this repository are the makings of the source code for the train system's subsystems. This project implements usage of a perfboard, mounting an AtMega328p microcontroller, leading to connections controlling a DC motor, servo motor, and an ultrasonic distance sensor.

This project was made in collaboaration with the following authors:

Shaqueir Tardif
Anthony Mitchell
Devaj Ramsamooj

*It was originally intended to use implement an LCD screen within the project to display when the mimic train system would successfully reach its "destinations" and inform users to upcoming "destination" stops. However, due to insufficient time and understanding of the LCD component and how to control it, it was unable to included within the final build of the overall system design.
